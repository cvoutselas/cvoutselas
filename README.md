- 💼 Currently working at TD Canada Trust, where I integrate data-driven insights into my daily interactions and operations.
- 📊 My projects span a diverse range, from analyzing Expected Goals in soccer and developing predictive models for bird species identification, to designing dynamic weather forecast web applications with Django, and strategizing to maximize profit in bank heists.
- 🛠 Proficient in Python, C++, SQL, HTML and various data science libraries and tools.
